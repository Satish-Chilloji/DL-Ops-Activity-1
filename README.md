1. Create a Python script to generate graphs for four different activation functions:

a. Sigmoid
b. ReLU
c. Leaky ReLU
d. Tanh

2. Create three branches: "feature-1", "feature-2", and "bug-fix".

a. In the "feature-1" branch, create a new file to print sigmoid for the
following data and commit changes:
random_values = [-3.5, -1.2, 0, 2.8, -4.1, 1.5, -0.7, 3.2, -2.4, 4.6]
b. In the "feature-2" branch, modify an existing file to print the output when
ReLU, Leaky ReLU, and Tanh are applied to the same data and commit changes.
c. In the "bug-fix" branch, fix an issue introduced in one of the previous
branches.

3. Merge Changes: Merge the changes from the "feature-1" and "feature-2" branches into
the main branch.
4. Resolve any merge conflicts.
